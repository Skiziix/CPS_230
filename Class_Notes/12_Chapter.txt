    JavaFx - Java's GUI library

    Pg. 761 #'s 12.1 - 12.4:
        1.) A user interface is something that allows an end-user
        to interact with your application.
        2.) A command line interface ouputs some text and asks the user
        to enter input in response.
        3.) The order of the program.
        4.) An event-driven program is one who's behavior is decided
        by user interaction (events).

    Pg. 765 #'s 12.5 - 12.14:
        5.) JavaFX is a GUI library
        6.) A window is analogous to a stage
        7.) A scene graph describes the connections between the base stage
        or window, and the different scenes.
        8.) There is the root node, branch node, and leaf node
        9.) Root nodes and branch nodes can have children, but leaves cannot.
        10.) Application
        11.) The launch method opens a window for the scenes to be displayed on the GUI
        12.) This method starts the program within the window and has to be overridden
        13.) This sets the title of the window
        14.) This actually displays the application's window.

    Pg. 772 #'s 12.15 - 12.19:
        15.) A HBox container aligns controls horizontally and a VBox container aligns controls vertically
        16.) To align things in a grid you would use the grid pane container
        17.) The scene class is in the javafx.scene package
        18.) You can change the alignment of an HBox container by using setAlignment and some enumerated Pos
        19.) The enumeration Pos is in the geometry package

    Pg. 776 #'s 12.20 - 12.24:
        20.) The package javafx.scene.image contains the ImageView and Image classes
        21.) You add and ImageView object
        22.) You use setFitWidth and setFitHeight
        23.) use use setPreserveRatio(true)
        24.) use setImage
